Migration Schedule
====================

U-Boot has been migrating to a new driver model since its introduction in
2014. This file describes the schedule for deprecation of pre-driver-model
features.


CONFIG_BLK
----------

Status: In progress
Deadline: 2018.05

Maintainers should submit patches for enabling CONFIG_BLK on all boards in
time for inclusion in the 2018.05 release. Boards not converted by this
time may be removed in a subsequent release.

Note that this implies use of driver model for all block devices (e.g.
MMC, USB, SCSI, SATA).

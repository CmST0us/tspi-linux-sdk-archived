config FLASH_CFI_DRIVER
	bool "Enable CFI Flash driver"
	help
	  The Common Flash Interface specification was developed by Intel,
	  AMD and other flash manufactures. It provides a universal method
	  for probing the capabilities of flash devices. If you wish to
	  support any device that is CFI-compliant, you need to enable this
	  option. Visit <http://www.amd.com/products/nvd/overview/cfi.html>
	  for more information on CFI.

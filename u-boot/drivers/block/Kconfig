config BLK
	bool "Support block devices"
	depends on DM
	default y if DM_MMC
	help
	  Enable support for block devices, such as SCSI, MMC and USB
	  flash sticks. These provide a block-level interface which permits
	  reading, writing and (in some cases) erasing blocks. Block
	  devices often have a partition table which allows the device to
	  be partitioned into several areas, called 'partitions' in U-Boot.
	  A filesystem can be placed in each partition.

config SPL_BLK
	bool "Support block devices in SPL"
	depends on SPL_DM && BLK
	default y
	help
	  Enable support for block devices, such as SCSI, MMC and USB
	  flash sticks. These provide a block-level interface which permits
	  reading, writing and (in some cases) erasing blocks. Block
	  devices often have a partition table which allows the device to
	  be partitioned into several areas, called 'partitions' in U-Boot.
	  A filesystem can be placed in each partition.

config SPL_BLK_READ_PREPARE
	bool "Support block devices prepare to read data in SPL"
	depends on SPL_BLK
	help
	  Enable support for block devices to prefetch data. MMC and mtd_blk
	  devices can be attached to block devices. It is applied to prefetch
	  data in the background and the device run some other process in the
	  same time.

config BLOCK_CACHE
	bool "Use block device cache"
	default n
	help
	  This option enables a disk-block cache for all block devices.
	  This is most useful when accessing filesystems under U-Boot since
	  it will prevent repeated reads from directory structures and other
	  filesystem data structures.

config IDE
	bool "Support IDE controllers"
	help
	  Enables support for IDE (Integrated Drive Electronics) hard drives.
	  This allows access to raw blocks and filesystems on an IDE drive
	  from U-Boot. See also CMD_IDE which provides an 'ide' command for
	  performing various IDE operations.

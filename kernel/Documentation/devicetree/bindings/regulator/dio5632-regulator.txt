DIO5632 regulators

Required properties:
- compatible: "DIO5632"
- reg: I2C slave address

Optional Subnode:
Device supports two regulators OUTP and OUTN. A sub node within the
   device node describe the properties of these regulators. The sub-node
   names must be as follows:
	-For regulator outp, the sub node name should be "outp".
	-For regulator outn, the sub node name should be "outn".

-enable-gpios:(active high, output) Regulators are controlled by the input pins.
   If it is connected to GPIO through host system then provide the
   gpio number as per gpio.txt.

Each regulator is defined using the standard binding for regulators.

Example:

	dio5632@3e {
		compatible = "DIO5632";
		reg = <0x3e>;

		outp {
			regulator-name = "outp";
			regulator-boot-on;
			regulator-always-on;
			enable-gpios = <&gpio0 RK_PB7 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		};

		outn {
			regulator-name = "outn";
			regulator-boot-on;
			regulator-always-on;
			enable-gpios = <&gpio0  RK_PC0 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		};
	};

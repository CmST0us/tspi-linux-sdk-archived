ROCKCHIP USB2.0 PHY WITH NANENG IP BLOCK

Required properties (phy (parent) node):
 - compatible : should be one of the listed compatibles:
	* "rockchip,rv1126-usb2phy"
 - reg : the address offset of grf for usb-phy configuration.
 - rockchip,grf : phandle to the syscon managing the "general register files"
 - clocks : phandle + phy specifier pair, for the input clocks of phy.
 - clock-names : input clocks name of phy.
 - resets : phandle + reset specifier pairs.
 - reset-names : reset names of phy.
 - #clock-cells : should be 0.
 - clock-output-names : specify the 480m output clock name.

Optional properties:
 - assigned-clocks : phandle of usb 480m clock.
 - assigned-clock-parents : parent of usb 480m clock, select between
		 usb-phy output 480m and xin24m.
		 Refer to clk/clock-bindings.txt for generic clock
		 consumer properties.
 - vbus-supply : regulator phandle for vbus power source.
 - wakeup-source : enable bvalid irq and linestate wakeup when suspend.
			only work when suspend wakeup-config is not work.
 - vup-gpios : gpio phandle for pull-up resistor on DM. this property
		is specially provided to RV1126/RV1109 in order to
		increase the amplitude of chirpK and successfully
		complete high speed handshake.

Required nodes : a sub-node is required for each port the phy provides.
		 The sub-node name is used to identify host or otg port,
		 and shall be the following entries:
	* "otg-port" : the name of otg port.
	* "host-port" : the name of host port.

Required properties (port (child) node):
 - #phy-cells : must be 0. See ./phy-bindings.txt for details.
 - interrupts : specify an interrupt for each entry in interrupt-names.
 - interrupt-names : a list which should be one of the following cases:
	Regular case:
	* "otg-id" : for the otg id interrupt.
	* "otg-bvalid" : for the otg vbus interrupt.
	* "linestate" : for the host/otg linestate interrupt.
	* "disconnect" : for the host/otg disconnect interrupt.

Optional properties:
 - phy-supply : phandle to a regulator that provides power to VBUS.
		See ./phy-bindings.txt for details.
 - rockchip,vbus-always-on: when set, indicates that the otg vbus
		is always powered on.

Example:

u2phy1: usb2-phy@ff4c8000 {
	compatible = "rockchip,rv1126-usb2phy";
	reg = <0xff4c8000 0x8000>;
	rockchip,grf = <&grf>;
	clocks = <&pmucru CLK_USBPHY_HOST_REF>, <&cru PCLK_USBPHY_HOST>;
	clock-names = "phyclk", "pclk";
	assigned-clocks = <&cru USB480M>;
	assigned-clock-parents = <&u2phy1>;
	resets = <&cru SRST_USBPHYPOR_HOST>, <&cru SRST_USBPHY_HOST_P>;
	reset-names = "u2phy", "u2phy-apb";
	#clock-cells = <0>;
	clock-output-names = "usb480m_phy";
	status = "disabled";

	u2phy_host: host-port {
		#phy-cells = <0>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 118 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
			     <GIC_SPI 119 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		interrupt-names = "linestate", "disconnect";
		status = "disabled";
	};
};
